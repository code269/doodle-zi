# Doodle - Winner of Best Front-End (CTP Homehacks 2020)

Built with React & Bootstrap, Doodle is a modern re-design of City University of New York (CUNY)'s Blackboard. 

The problem with Blackboard is that there are many features that are unused/unnecessary. With such an abundance in unnecessary feaures, this causes clunkiness, leading to users (CUNY students) to feel confused and overwhelmed with the website. The website is also extremely text heavy, which I found poorly designed and outdated. The lack of a decent user interface and cumbersome web design both contribute to student dissatisfaction. 

Doodle was created by students, for students. We aimed for a better design and interface, while shaving off all the unnecessary features that Blackboard consisted of. This cuts down the amount of time for a user to learn how to use the website. <...>
