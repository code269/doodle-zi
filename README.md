# What is Doodle?

Built with React & Bootstrap, Doodle is a modern re-design of City University of New York (CUNY)'s Blackboard. 

The issue with Blackboard is that there are many features that are unused/unnecessary. With such an abundance in unnecessary feaures, this causes clunkiness, leading to users (CUNY students) to feel confused and overwhelmed with the website. The website is also extremely text heavy, which was found poorly designed and outdated. The lack of a decent user interface and cumbersome web design both contribute to student dissatisfaction. 

Doodle was created by students, for students. We aimed for a better design and interface, while shaving off all the unnecessary features that Blackboard consisted of. This cuts down the amount of time for a user to learn how to use the website. <...>

# What's next for Doodle?

We hope to improve the project together by implementing the many features we have in mind. One of our ideas is to add a chat with channels for students to communicate with one another, which is incredibly important to do especially in a time where there is no face-to-face classes. This will greatly enhance their virtual learning experiences as well as expand their networks. We also want to implement the graphs & charts that would help visualize grades to facilitate students and provide them with a better understanding of their performance.
